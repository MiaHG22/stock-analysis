##Overview of Project:

This project is to use VBA in Excel to help our client Steve to analyze the 12 green energy stocks' performance between 2017 and 2018. With the given dataset, VBA script was created. To save time on the execution, the refactored script was also done. 

##Results:
From the results of the initiate VBA script, we can see that it took 606.625 seconds to run the analysis for 2017 and 4594.69 seconds for 2018. By comparing to the results of the refactored VBA script, we can see that the refactored script is much more effiency. It took about 0.167 seconds to run the analysis for 2017 and 0.171 seconds for 2018.
